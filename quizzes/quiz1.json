            "question": "What does it mean for an astronomical body to be tidally locked?",
            "correct_answer": "It means the body has reached a state where there is no net change in its rotation rate over the course of a complete orbit, often resulting in the same side always facing its partner."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why does the same side of the Moon always face Earth?",
            "correct_answer": "The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, meaning it has synchronous rotation and takes just as long to rotate around its axis as it does to revolve around Earth."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are some alternative names for the tidal locking process?",
            "correct_answer": "Alternative names for tidal locking include gravitational locking, captured rotation, and spin-orbit locking."
