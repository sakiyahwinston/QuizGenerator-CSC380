        "question": " does it mean for an astronomical body to be tidally locked?",
        "options": [
          "Its rotation period matches its orbital period, causing the same side to always face its partner.",
          "It has stopped rotating entirely due to gravitational forces.",
          "It rotates faster over time due to tidal forces.",
          "Its orbit becomes perfectly circular due to tidal interactions."

        "question": "Why does the same side of the Moon always face Earth?",
        "options": [
          "The Moon’s rotation is too slow to reveal its far side.",
          "The Moon is tidally locked, meaning it rotates at the same rate it orbits Earth.",
          "The Moon’s magnetic field forces it to always face Earth.",
          "Earth’s gravity prevents the Moon from rotating."

        "correct_answer": "The Moon is tidally locked, meaning it rotates at the same rate it orbits Earth."

        "question": "What are some alternative names for the tidal locking process?",

          "Orbital freezing, rotational capture, tidal anchoring",
          "Gravity lock, moon lock, rotation hold",
